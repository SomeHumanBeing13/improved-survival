------------------------

Optimized Survival is a modpack that aims to improve the survival experience in areas that vanilla Minecraft struggles in.

As of now, there are 4 categories that this 
modpack works in:

------------------------

### Enchanting

The mods [Enchant Tweaker](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchant-tweaker) and [Enchanting Infuser](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchanting-infuser) Improve Enchanting by making it less of an RNG grind. You can visit the mods' pages to learn more about them.


------------------------


### World Generation

In Optimized Survival, there are a few mods that change the world generation that will feel more fresh than the vanilla generation.

#### Overworld

[Tectonic](https://modrinth.com/mod/tectonic) and [Additional Structures](https://modrinth.com/mod/additional-structures) are the main mods that affect world generation in the Overworld. There are a couple smaller ones, and I do plan on adding some of the "YUNG's better _____" mods when they are released for 1.20.

#### The Nether

The Nether isn't changed.

#### The End

The [Better End](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterend) mod overhauls The End completely adding new blocks, tools, armor, biomes, and more. This would be the End update we all have been waiting for. I recommend you check out the mod page to learn more.


------------------------


### Performance and QOL

Improved Survival is based on [Fabulously Optmized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized). FO is a performance modpack that includes the best mods that are crafted for the sole purpose of making your game run as fast as possible.

Along with FO, there are a number of QOL mods that add useful features, or just make the game look pretty.


------------------------

### Difficulty

Finally, the difficulty of the game has been improved in a couple ways.

[Dungeon Difficulty](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeon-difficulty) is a mod that increases the strength and rewards of mobs based off of the biome they are in.

[EDF Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/edf-remastered) is a mod that makes the Ender Dragon fight more fun and challenging by introducing new attacks and increased health.

[End Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/endrem) is a mod that makes getting the eyes needed to go through the end portal more challenging by adding custom eyes of ender to the game.
